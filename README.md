# Snippet Loader

> WordPress plugin to autoload snippets and display them in the backend.

This plugin is meant to be a lightweight developer tool. It's a backend UI strapped to an autoloader. Instead of browsing your snippets folder you can refer to the UI to see what snippets you have and which are active. I believe managing snippets should remain a developer task, so the backend will not get that functionality.
